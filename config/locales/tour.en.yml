    source_description_html: |
      We have focused on making access to the source code easy and transparent. Every file pushed to git repository will instantly become available for online access,
      so you can share it with other developers even if they don't use Git. Home page of every project contains list of project files,
      as well as information about recent changes. You can immediately see the most important part of your project: the code.
    history_description_html: |
      Every file in git repository has history of modifications which can be easily looked through using ABF to see who and when modified the file
      and which changes were introduced by particular commits.
    annotation_description_html: 'Looking for the author of a particular code fragment? Just open the file blame to see who modified that fragment for the last time and in which commit.'

    control_description_html: |
      There are 3 possible levels of privileges for project members: read-only, read/write, and administration level. A project member can designate a real user
      or a group of developers. Both projects and groups may have unlimited number of members (every of which can be in turn a user or a group).
    tracker_description_html: |
      Every project may use a lightweight and simple task tracker. Labels and assignments will allow not to get lost in tasks,
      while convenient interface will allow to concentrate on a real work, not filling huge forms.
